# Rotten Tomatoes: "Tomatometer" vs "Popcornmeter"

Using movie review data from Rotten Tomatoes along with supplemental data on Oscar awards and domestic box office numbers, this data analytics project analyzed differences and trends in three groups: movies rated highly by critics only, movies rated highly by audiences only and movies rated highly by both critics and audiences.

This analysis aims to uncover interesting trends and insights concerning the gap between critic and audience reviews. The analysis includes changes over time for each review group, differences in movie genres and directors between the three groups, and influences on box office numbers and Oscar awards won for each group.

## The project focused on the following questions:

1. Has the divergence between critic and audience reviews increased over time?
2. Which genres are more susceptible to the gap between critic and audience?
3. Do critic and audience reviewers favor different directors?
4. Do audience ratings have a stronger influence on box office numbers?
5. Do critic ratings have a stronger influence on awards won?
